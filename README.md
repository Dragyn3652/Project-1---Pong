# Project-1--- Javascript Pong

I created this game because I thought it would give me a chance to work through some really programming challenges I've encountered since beginning the WDI program. To win you have to get to 5 points.

This is a two player game. The winner will be the first one to achieve 5 points.
Player 1 uses the 'q' and 'a' keys
Player 2 uses the 'p' and 'l' keys

I used html, css, canvas, and javascript.
